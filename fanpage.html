    <p class="styledFont">
        Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as Katy Perry,
        is an American singer, songwriter, and television judge. After singing in church during
        her childhood, she pursued a career in gospel music as a teenager. Perry signed with Red Hill Records and
        released her debut studio album Katy Hudson under
        her birth name in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. 
    </p>
    <p class="styledFont">
        She moved to Los Angeles the following year to
        venture into secular music after Red Hill
        ceased operations and she subsequently began working with producers Glen Ballard,
        Dr. Luke, and Max Martin. After adopting the stage name Katy Perry and being dropped by
        The Island Def Jam Music Group and Columbia Records, she signed a recording contract with Capitol Records in
        April 2007.
